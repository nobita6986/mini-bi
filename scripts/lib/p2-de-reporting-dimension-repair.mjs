/**
 * P2 Direct Entry reporting dimension classification hotfix - shared repair plan.
 *
 * Root cause proven read-only against Production: the 17 imported facts carry a
 * canonical stored provider_type (6 hrp / 11 vendor) and a recruiter_id, but
 *   * recruiter_provider_memberships.valid_from = 2026-10-06 is AFTER their
 *     first_work_date (2026-10-02..2026-10-05), so
 *     direct_entry_reporting_recruiter_provider_key() finds no effective row;
 *   * recruiter_aliases has no row at all for those recruiters, so
 *     direct_entry_reporting_recruiter_alias_key() finds no reporting key.
 * Both helpers therefore return the '__unknown__' sentinel and the Dashboard
 * groups the rows under "Không xác định".
 *
 * The correction is derived from evidence that already exists in the database -
 * never from an assumption:
 *   * provider: the single membership row per recruiter must carry the same
 *     provider_type as every stored fact of that recruiter, and only its
 *     valid_from is re-dated;
 *   * recruiter key: HRP uses recruiters.personnel_code, Vendor uses
 *     recruiter_provider_memberships.vendor_id, written into the designed
 *     reporting vocabulary table recruiter_aliases.
 *
 * R1 (T0 review of d8d5caa) hardening:
 *   * the anchor date is the earliest first_work_date of the recruiter's facts
 *     INSIDE the reporting window (SUBMITTED, not deleted, >= cutoff) - Draft or
 *     out-of-window rows can never pull the timeline further back;
 *   * a derived reporting key that another recruiter already uses after the
 *     anchor date is refused instead of merging two people onto one key;
 *   * every audit row carries the operating actor (auth_subject + app_user_id),
 *     the capability actually held and a restricted reason_id;
 *   * the acceptance check compares the WHOLE window against the expected
 *     post-repair distribution, so a second run after a successful repair is a
 *     valid no-op instead of a failure.
 *
 * The module is pure except for SQL text: the CLI script and the DB regression
 * test execute the exact same statements.
